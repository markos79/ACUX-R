ACUX-R mobile recommender


ACUX-R Evaluation
In the framework of the PhD dissertation of Markos Constantakis, a member of ii research group, we present ACUX Recommender (ACUx-R), a mobile recommendation system (MRS)for recommending personalised cultural POIs to visitors based on their visiting preferences. ACUX-R experimentally employs the ACUX typology (Konstantakis, 2022) for assigning profiles to cultural visitors. The ACUX typology is the outcome of a harmonisation of existing cultural-visitor typologies that base their classification on visiting preferences. 
The application is designed for Android users and corresponds to points of interest in the Attica region; hence, its use is recommended for users who travel in Attica.
